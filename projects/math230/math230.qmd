During the second semester of my first year at Bucknell, I took a math class called Data Visualization and Computing.  This class was my first introduction to R, and I learned a lot about the language and how to use it to construct helpful visualizations.  The class culminated with a final project: a website that acted in part as a portfolio, housing the work that we had done throughout the year.  The other aspect of the project was more open-ended, allowing us to build visualizations on a topic of our choice.  I chose to examine the 2021 MLB season, and I crafted visualizations analyzing pitcher performance during that year.  Use the link here to take a look!
